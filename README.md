# COVID-19 Impact Analytics 🇺🇸🦠📊

A comprehensive data analysis project exploring the public health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Conducted as part of the **CIE 457 - Statistical Inference** course at the University of Science and Technology.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project utilizes two major datasets:
- **COVID-19 Case Surveillance Data**
- **Household Pulse Survey Data**

We performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **hypothesis testing**, **regression modeling**, and **machine learning classification** to answer key questions about:
- Hospitalization and death trends
- ICU admittance
- Employment loss by demographic and state
- Delay in medical treatment
- Predicting death probability based on multiple attributes

## 📊 Key Analyses

- 📈 **Hospitalizations vs Deaths over Time**
- 👵 **Death and Hospitalization by Age, Gender, Race**
- 🧾 **State-level Healthcare Outcome Differences**
- 💼 **Employment Loss by Sector and Demographic**
- 💊 **Access to Medical Treatment by Income**
- 🧪 **Hypothesis Testing** on mortality risk
- 🧠 **Regression Models** to predict death rates
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Classifiers**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Neural Network (128-64-Sigmoid, Adam optimizer)

## 📌 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Statistical hypothesis testing (Chi-square, p-values)
- Regression & Correlation analysis
- Neural Networks & Random Forest (Binary classification)

## 🧠 Bonus Insights

- Prediction of death likelihood based on features using ML
- Identification of risk factors and key predictors
- Evaluation of ICU effectiveness in reducing mortality

## 🧪 Key Results

- Age and pre-existing conditions strongly correlate with death probability
- Males had higher COVID-19 mortality rates than females
- States like California had high economic impact payments
- Self-employed individuals were hit hardest economically
- Machine learning models achieved good predictive power for COVID death outcomes

## 📎 Limitations

- Incomplete or missing data in ICU and race attributes
- Variability in state-level reporting policies
- Non-inclusion of detailed clinical history
